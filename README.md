# web3.0Blockchainproject
This project is a build and deployment of a Modern Web 3.0 Blockchain App using Solidity, Smart Contracts and Crypto. Thanks to adrianhajdin for the inspiration on the build.

The main dependancies needed for the setup are:
1) Vite instead of using a direct create react app vitejs.dev ( npm init vite@latest => React => js ) after initializing it we are using "npm install" and then "npm run dev" in terminal to run the local host
2) We are also using tailwind css in this project. on the following link you can find the documents needed to set it up: https://tailwindcss.com/docs/guides/create-react-app
