# Basic Sample Hardhat Project

This project includes Hardhat use case so it will demonstrate a sample contract and a test for that contract
and within it a sample script that plays a role deploying that contract
and in the end it includes an example of a task implementation (lists available accounts)

The tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
